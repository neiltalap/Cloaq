We follow the Conventional Commits specification for commit messages. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.

COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT

Each commit message consists of a header, a body, and a footer.

<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>

The header is mandatory. The scope of the header is optional.

HEADER

The header has a special format that includes a Type, a Scope, and a Subject:

TYPE

Must be one of the following:

*   feat: A new feature
*   fix: A bug fix
*   docs: Documentation only changes
*   style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
*   refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
*   perf: A code change that improves performance
*   test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
*   chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

SCOPE (Optional)

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. Examples:
*   tap
*   routing
*   api
*   core

SUBJECT

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:
*   Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
*   Don't capitalize the first letter
*   No dot (.) at the end

EXAMPLE

feat(tap): add tap interface creation logic

If the commit introduces a breaking change, append ! after the type/scope, or include BREAKING CHANGE: in the footer.
