# Cloaq (UDAL)

> **Universal Decentralized Anonymity Layer**
> A protocol-agnostic privacy transport that decouples identity from connectivity.

## Features

-   **Identity Decoupling**: No IP-based tracking.
-   **Decentralized**: No central authorities; every node is a relay.
-   **High Performance**: Near-WireGuard speeds with onion routing.
-   **Protocol Agnostic**: Supports TCP, UDP, and P2P traffic.

## Usage

```bash
# Build
go build -o cloaq src/*.go

# Run (requires root for TUN interface)
sudo ./cloaq run
```
