# UDAL — Universal Decentralized Anonymity Layer

**UDAL** is a protocol-agnostic, decentralized anonymity transport layer that **decouples identity from connectivity**.

It turns every connected device into a **private gateway**, enabling **Tor-level anonymity** with **WireGuard-level performance**.

UDAL is designed as a foundational layer for privacy-preserving networking — independent of application protocols, platforms, or trust anchors.

## Core Principles

- **Identity Decoupling**  
  Network identity is separated from physical connectivity and IP addressing.

- **Protocol Agnostic**  
  Works beneath application protocols — HTTP, TCP, UDP, custom transports.

- **Decentralized by Design**  
  No central relays, directories, or authorities.

- **High Performance**  
  Optimized routing and cryptography for near–WireGuard throughput.

- **Composable Privacy**  
  Can be embedded into existing systems without redesigning the stack.

## What UDAL Is (and Is Not)

### UDAL Is
- A **transport-layer anonymity system**
- A **privacy-first routing fabric**
- A **building block** for secure applications, services, and devices

### UDAL Is Not
- A VPN replacement
- A Tor fork
- An application-layer anonymity tool

---

## Architecture (High-Level)

- Each node acts as:
  - A **client**
  - A **relay**
  - A **gateway**
- Traffic is:
  - Onion-routed
  - Cryptographically unlinkable
  - Dynamically path-selected
- No node has full knowledge of:
  - Source
  - Destination
  - Payload

> Detailed architecture documentation will be provided in `/docs`.

## Project Status

**Early-stage / Active development**

- APIs and wire formats may change
- Not production-ready
- Security audits pending
