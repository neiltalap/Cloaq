DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND INTENT

1. Absolute Non-Affiliation: This project is a strictly independent, open-source initiative. 
It has absolutely no affiliation, sponsorship, or association with any state, government, 
public agency, or state-funded incubator anywhere on Earth. No government grants, 
public funds, or state resources were utilized in its architecture, deployment or current operation.

2. Purpose and Intent: This software is engineered strictly as a tool of freedom, privacy, 
and technical autonomy. It was developed with zero malicious intent. It is expressly 
not to be used as a catalyst for vile acts, oppression, surveillance, or the violation of human rights.

STRICT PROHIBITION OF STATE CO-OPTATION & FRAUDULENT CLAIMS

1. Sovereign Independence: This repository is a sovereign, independent asset. No entity, whether 
a government, corporation, public agency, private institution, incubator, or individual, 
has the authorization to claim this project, its creators, or its output as their own 
initiative, proprietary success, or "domestic achievement."

2. Declaration of Fraud: Any claim by any organization, state apparatus, or 
media outlet that this project constitutes their success, or sponsored achievement is categorically 
false and constitutes deliberate fraud. The creators explicitly deny any unauthorized association. 
Co-opting this work for state propaganda, corporate public relations, regional rankings, or political 
and financial capital is an unauthorized manipulation of our identity, metrics, and labor.

3. Revocation of Rights: Any attempt by any entity, or its proxies, to falsely claim credit for, 
or co-opt the public narrative of this project, immediately and permanently invalidates their right to utilize, 
fork, modify, or distribute this software under any license provided herein.

4. Contributor Binding & Expulsion:
This strict prohibition of co-optation applies universally to all current and future contributors, 
maintainers, and independent contractors associated with this project. Any contributor who publicly 
aligns this project with a state apparatus, corporation, or unauthorized incubator, or leverages their contribution
to secure unauthorized state funding, public relations, or political capital, is in direct violation of 
this project’s core sovereignty. Such actions will result in immediate revocation of repository access, 
termination of associated contracts, and absolute public disavowal of their statements.

5. Absolute Financial Decoupling:
Any financial contributions, donations, or grants sent to this project, its maintainers, or its 
holding entities grant the sender zero equity, zero editorial control, and zero rights to publicize 
the transaction for public relations or political capital. Unsolicited funds from state apparatuses, 
public agencies, or corporate entities establish no reciprocal obligation and 
do not constitute a sponsorship or partnership.

6. The Right to Pseudonymity:
The maintainers and contributors to this repository reserve the absolute right to operate under 
cryptographic or functional pseudonyms. Any attempt by a state apparatus, media outlet, or corporate entity 
to dox, de-anonymize, or geographically locate contributors for the purpose of political pressure, 
conscription of labor, or unauthorized PR is considered a hostile act against the project's integrity. 
The value of this project lies strictly in its code, not in the physical identities or nationalities of its architects.

7. Decentralized Mirroring & Anti-Censorship:
This software is designed to be highly resilient. In the event of localized ISP blocking, 
state-level censorship, or platform-level takedowns, the global open-source community is explicitly 
authorized and encouraged to fork, mirror, and redistribute this repository across decentralized 
networks and alternative version control platforms. No single geographic or corporate choke 
point shall dictate the availability of this tool.
